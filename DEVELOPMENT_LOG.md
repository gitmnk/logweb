- Error handling and debug logging implemented 

### Local Development Setup

#### Option 1: Using Chromium with Web Security Disabled
For testing speech recognition on localhost (development only):
```bash
# Run Chromium with web security disabled (development only, do not use for regular browsing)
chromium --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev" --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure="http://localhost:3000"
```

**Important**: This configuration should only be used for local development and testing. For production, always use HTTPS.

#### Option 2: Using ngrok for HTTPS
For secure HTTPS access during development:

1. Install ngrok from https://ngrok.com/download
2. Copy the example configuration:
```bash
cp ngrok.yml.example ngrok.yml
```
3. Get your auth token from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
4. Replace `${NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN}` in `ngrok.yml` with your token
5. Start ngrok:
```bash
ngrok start --config ngrok.yml web
```

**Note**: 
- The `ngrok.yml` file is gitignored to protect your auth token
- Use the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok to test speech recognition
- Free tier of ngrok limits you to 1 simultaneous session
